# DGEMM on KNL

## Overview

Include DGEMM code tunned for KNL. The purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to tune a general GEMM algorithm for a specific hardware (i.e. Intel KNL). Thus the implemented GEMM do not cover the case where input is not multiply of kernel size.




## Notice to UC Berkeley CS267 student
You should **NOT** using this code (in part or whole) for your GEMM assignment. A modifed copy of this repo has been submitted as student homework to ensure the autograder have a copy of this repo. Using part or whole of this code is considered as violation of UC Berkeley Student Honor Code and would be reported to Center for Student Conduct.
